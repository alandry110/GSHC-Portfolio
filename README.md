# Good Samaritan Health Center 

A collection of visually impactful updates and reports that use emotional appeal and census analytics to summarize patient, staff, and donor relationships at Good Samaritan Health Center. All rights and materials belong to Good Samaritan Health Center.

These projects showcase the work that I helped to complete in my role as a Marketing and Communications Coordinator. My primary responsibilities included designing layout, collecting patient/staff photos and stories, and working directly with Chief Development Officer for editorial recommendations and final approvals.
